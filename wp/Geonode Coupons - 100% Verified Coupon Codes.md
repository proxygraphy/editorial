## How Geonode Sources IP Addresses

Geonode is one of the few proxy providers that openly shares how they gather IPs. Instead of shady methods, Geonode uses a transparent, ethical process:

- **Bandwidth Sharing via Repocket**: End users voluntarily share unused bandwidth across devices, whether mobile, desktop, or datacenter.
- **Developer SDKs**: Geonode provides tools that developers can embed into apps to collect IPs via opt-in mechanisms.
- **Internal Infrastructure**: Their Zenshield program oversees compliance and actively blocks suspicious traffic.

This process not only ensures legal and ethical standards but also keeps the IP pool clean, reliable, and safe for business use.

## Final Thoughts

If you value speed, scalability, and ethical sourcing, Geonode is worth trying. With proxy coupons offering up to 75% off and $0.50/GB enterprise pricing, it's one of the most affordable premium proxy options.

Take advantage of their flexible trial plans and discover why data professionals trust Geonode to handle their critical tasks.
