## üî•Key Features of IPRoyal:

### 1. Many Proxy Types to Explore and Test

[IPRoyal](https://proxygraphy.com/aff/iproyal) provides three major proxy types, each crafted for distinct purposes:

**Residential**

These proxies use IPs from real devices, making them harder to detect. They‚Äôre best for accessing geo-restricted sites or conducting research where authenticity matters. The trade-off? Slightly slower speeds, but much better stealth.

**Datacenter Proxies**

Powered by cloud servers, datacenter proxies offer excellent speed and are great for scraping or tracking. However, they may be flagged by some websites due to their artificial IP nature.

**Mobile Proxies**

These connect through actual mobile networks, making them ideal for testing apps or managing social media where appearing as a real user is critical.

### 2. Extensive Global Coverage

IPRoyal‚Äôs proxy pool spans across **190+ countries**, allowing users to reach content from nearly any region. Whether you're *analyzing SEO* in different markets or accessing country-specific platforms, this global access gives you the reach you need.
